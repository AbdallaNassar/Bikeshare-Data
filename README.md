# Bikeshare-Data
Udacity Data Analyst Degree - Project II

## Overview
Hey there! I'm excited to be working on a project where I'll be diving into some data related to bike share systems in three major cities in the US: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I'll be using Python to write some code that will help me import this data and answer some interesting questions about it. Specifically, I'll be computing descriptive statistics to get a better understanding of the trends and patterns in the data.

## What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, I'll require the following softwares:

- Python 
- A text editor, like Sublime or Atom
- A terminal application

# The Datasets
The datasets provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the US, contains randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. The data files for all three cities contain the same core six columns:

- Start Time 
- End Time 
- Trip Duration 
- Start Station 
- End Station 
- User Type 

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

- Gender
- Birth Year

## Answering Questions
Through writing code, I'm able to answer the following questions about the bike share data:

- What month occurs most often in the start time?
- What day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) occurs most often in the start time? 
- What hour of the day occurs most often in the start time?
- What is the total trip duration and average trip duration?
- What is the most frequently used start station and most frequently used end station?
- What is the most common trip (i.e., the combination of start station and end station that occurs the most often)?
- What are the counts of each user type?
- What are the counts of gender?
- What is the earliest birth year (when the oldest person was born), most recent birth year, and most common birth year?
